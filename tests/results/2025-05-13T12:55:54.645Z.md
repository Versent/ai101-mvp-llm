It is widely used in software development but can be applied to various types of projects.\n\nKey principles of Agile include:\n\n1. **Iterative Development:** Work is divided into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Each iteration results in a potentially shippable product increment.\n\n2. **Customer Collaboration:** Continuous involvement of the customer or product owner to provide feedback and prioritize features.\n\n3. **Responding to Change:** Agile welcomes changing requirements, even late in development, to better meet customer needs.\n\n4. **Cross-functional Teams:** Teams are self-organizing and include members with various skills needed to complete the work.\n\n5. **Continuous Improvement:** Regular reflection on processes and outcomes to improve efficiency and quality.\n\nPopular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP).\n\nAt Versent, Agile methodologies are often employed to ensure rapid delivery, adaptability, and close alignment with client goals during digital transformation and cloud-native projects. If you want, I can provide more specific information about how Versent uses Agile or details on particular frameworks.",
